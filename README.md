## Installation

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd URDB_JSON_Viewer_v2
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run src/main.py
```

### Development Setup

For development with testing and code quality tools:

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Format code
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

## Usage

### Loading Tariff Files
- Place your URDB JSON files in the `tariffs/` subdirectory
- The application will automatically detect and list available tariff files
- Select a tariff file from the sidebar to begin analysis

### Editing Rates
1. **Select Rate Type**: Choose between "Energy" or "Demand" rates
2. **Choose Time Period**: Select month, hour, and day type (weekday/weekend)
3. **Modify Rate**: Enter the new rate value
4. **Apply Changes**: Click "Update Rate" to apply modifications
5. **Save Changes**: Use "Save Changes" to export modified tariffs

### Understanding the Visualizations
- **Energy Rates**: Displayed in $/kWh with blue color gradients
- **Demand Rates**: Displayed in $/kW with similar color schemes
- **Flat Demand Rates**: Monthly bar charts showing seasonal demand charges
- **Combined View**: Comparative analysis and rate distribution charts

## Data Structure Support

The application supports the following URDB JSON fields:

### Energy Rates
- `energyratestructure`: Rate structure with tiers and rates
- `energyweekdayschedule`: Weekday hourly schedule mapping
- `energyweekendschedule`: Weekend hourly schedule mapping

### Demand Charges
- `demandratestructure`: Demand rate structure with tiers and rates
- `demandweekdayschedule`: Weekday demand schedule mapping
- `demandweekendschedule`: Weekend demand schedule mapping
- `flatdemandstructure`: Seasonal/monthly flat demand rates
- `flatdemandmonths`: Month-to-period mapping for flat demand

### Additional Fields
- `demandrateunit`: Unit for demand charges (kW, kVA, etc.)
- `demandwindow`: Demand measurement window in minutes
- `demandratchetpercentage`: Demand ratchet percentages
- `demandreactivepowercharge`: Reactive power charges

## File Format

The application expects URDB JSON files in the standard format:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "utility": "Utility Company Name",
      "name": "Rate Name",
      "sector": "Residential/Commercial/Industrial",
      "energyratestructure": [...],
      "demandratestructure": [...],
      "energyweekdayschedule": [...],
      "demandweekdayschedule": [...],
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output

Modified tariffs are saved to the `modified_tariffs/` directory with the prefix "modified_" added to the original filename.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit 1.26.0+
- Pandas 1.5.0+

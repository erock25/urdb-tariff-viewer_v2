#   2. Click Settings → Secrets
#   3. Copy the contents below and add your actual API key
# 
# For Local Development:
#   1. Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml
#   2. Add your actual API key

# OpenAI Configuration (for AI Schedule Assistant)
# ============================================================================

[openai]
# Your OpenAI API key (get from platform.openai.com)
# Replace with your actual key starting with "sk-"
api_key = "sk-your-api-key-here"

# Model to use for schedule generation
# Options:
#   - "gpt-4o" (RECOMMENDED) - Best accuracy for complex schedules ($0.003-$0.005 per request)
#   - "gpt-4o-mini" - Faster and cheaper but may struggle with boundary logic ($0.0002-$0.0005 per request)
#   - "gpt-4" - Legacy model, most expensive (~$0.03-$0.05 per request)
# Note: Based on testing, gpt-4o is REQUIRED for reliable split-period handling
model = "gpt-4o"

# Maximum tokens for AI response
# Range: 1000-4000
# Recommended: 2000 (sufficient for most schedules)
max_tokens = 2000

# Temperature for AI generation (creativity vs consistency)
# Range: 0.0-2.0
# Recommended: 0.1 (very consistent, low creativity)
# Lower = more consistent, Higher = more creative
temperature = 0.1


# ============================================================================
# Optional: Additional Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Add any additional secrets your deployment might need below
# Examples:
#   - Database credentials
#   - External API keys
#   - Authentication tokens

# [database]
# host = "your-database-host"
# username = "your-username"
# password = "your-password"
